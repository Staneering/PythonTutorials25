Exercises for data_structures
1. Exercise for lists.py
Objective: Work with lists and perform various list operations.

Exercise:

Create a list with the following items: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Add a new element 6 to the end of the list.

Modify the second element of the list to be 10.

Print the first and last elements of the list.

Slice the list to print the first three elements.

Iterate through the list and print each element.

2. Exercise for tuples.py
Objective: Work with tuples and perform basic tuple operations.

Exercise:

Create a tuple with the following elements: (10, 20, 30, "apple", "banana").

Access and print the second element of the tuple.

Try to modify the third element (should raise an error).

Print the length of the tuple.

Count how many times the string "apple" appears in the tuple.

Unpack the tuple into variables and print them.

3. Exercise for dictionaries.py
Objective: Work with dictionaries and perform dictionary operations.

Exercise:

Create a dictionary to represent a student:

python
Copy
student = {"name": "John", "age": 21, "major": "Computer Science"}
Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary: "graduation_year": 2023.

Access and print the value of the key "name".

Iterate through the dictionary and print each key and its corresponding value.

Check if the key "age" exists in the dictionary.

Remove the "major" key from the dictionary.

4. Exercise for sets.py

Exercise:

Create a set with the following elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Add a new element 6 to the set.

Remove an element 3 from the set.

Check if the number 2 is in the set.

Create another set: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Find the union, intersection, and difference of the two sets.

Iterate over the set and print each element.
