## Introduction

This project is aimed at helping learners solidify their understanding of Python through hands-on exercises. The topics covered range from the basics of Python (such as variables, control structures, and functions) to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, file handling, data visualization, and even an introduction to machine learning.

---

## Python Basics

### Data Types
Learn about Python's basic data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans, and `None`. You'll practice operations like addition, string concatenation, and comparison.

### Variables and Constants
Understand how to define and use variables, as well as how to manage constants in Python.

### Control Structures
Understand decision-making using `if-else` statements, loops (for and while), and other control structures. 

### Functions and Return Values
Learn how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values. Practice creating reusable code with functions.

---

## Data Structures

### Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
Learn how to use these fundamental data structures. Lists are mutable collections, tuples are immutable, and dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.

### Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Learn how to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

### List Comprehensions
Understand and use Python’s powerful list comprehension syntax to create lists in a concise and readable way.

### Introduction to Arrays (NumPy Basics)
Get an introduction to arrays with the `NumPy` library. Arrays are an efficient way to store and manipulate numerical data.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects
Learn the basics of object-oriented programming. Create classes to define objects with specific attributes and methods.

### Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation
Understand the principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in Python’s object-oriented programming.

### Class Methods and Static Methods
Understand the difference between instance methods, class methods, and static methods. Learn when to use each.

### Magic Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)
Learn about magic methods (also known as dunder methods) that allow you to customize how objects behave. For example, `__init__` for initialization and `__str__` for string representation.

---

## Modules and Libraries

### Importing Standard Libraries
Learn how to import and use Python's standard libraries (e.g., `math`, `random`, `datetime`) for various tasks.

### Working with External Libraries
Learn how to install and use external libraries, such as `requests` for making HTTP requests and `pandas` for data manipulation.

---

## Error Handling and Exceptions

### Try/Except Blocks
Understand how to handle errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.

### Custom Exceptions
Learn how to create your own exceptions in Python to handle specific errors that may arise in your programs.

### Debugging with `pdb`
Learn how to use Python's built-in debugger (`pdb`) to step through your code, inspect variables, and troubleshoot issues.

---

## File Handling

### Reading and Writing Text Files
Learn how to work with text files, including reading from and writing to files.

### Working with CSV and JSON Files
Understand how to read and write data to CSV and JSON files, which are common formats for storing structured data.

---

## Data Visualization

### Introduction to `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
Learn how to use the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive plots.

### Plotting Basic Charts
Understand how to create basic charts, such as line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.

---

## Working with APIs

### Making Requests
Learn how to use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to web services and retrieve data.

### Parsing JSON Data
Understand how to parse JSON data returned by APIs and manipulate the data in Python.

### Handling API Errors
Learn how to handle errors and exceptions when working with APIs, such as timeouts and invalid responses.

---

## Advanced Topics

### Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
Learn how to use the `BeautifulSoup` library to scrape data from websites and process the content.

### Multithreading with `threading`
Understand the basics of concurrency in Python using the `threading` module to run multiple threads in parallel.

### Introduction to Machine Learning (scikit-learn Basics)
Get a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and how to use the `scikit-learn` library for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.

---

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/python-data-structures.git
   cd python-data-structures
   ```

2. **Navigate to the source code**:
   - All the core scripts for Python basics and data structures are located in the `src/` folder.
   - Each topic (e.g., `data_types.py`, `control_structures.py`, etc.) contains exercises and implementations for the topic.

3. **Work on the exercises**:
   - Open the scripts in your favorite text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm).
   - Complete the exercises by writing code for the defined tasks.

4. **Test your solutions**:
   - The `tests/` folder contains test files for each module.
   - Run tests with `pytest` to validate your code:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/
     ```

---

## Running Tests

1. **Install `pytest`** if you don't have it already:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Run all tests** in the project:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

   This will run the tests for both the **Python basics** and **data structures** scripts. You will see whether your code passes the test cases and if there are any issues to address.
