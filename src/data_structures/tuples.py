# Tuples in Python

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", True)

# Accessing elements
print("First element:", my_tuple[0])
print("Last element:", my_tuple[-1])

# Tuples are immutable, so we can't change them directly
# For example, this will raise an error:
# my_tuple[1] = "banana"  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
