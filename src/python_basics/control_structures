# Control Structures in Python

# 1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
# Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

# Example 1: Basic if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print(f"x is greater than 5")
else:
    print(f"x is less than or equal to 5")

# Example 2: Using elif for multiple conditions
y = 20
if y < 10:
    print(f"y is less than 10")
elif y < 30:
    print(f"y is less than 30 but greater than or equal to 10")
else:
    print(f"y is 30 or greater")

# Example 3: Nested if statements
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    if age >= 21:
        print(f"Adult and can drink legally in many countries")
    else:
        print(f"Adult but can't drink legally in many countries")
else:
    print(f"Not an adult yet")

# 2. Loops: for and while

# For loop: Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.)

# Example 1: Using a for loop with a range
print("\nFor loop examples:")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4

# Example 2: Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)  # Prints each fruit name

# Example 3: Using for loop with a range and step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (steps of 2)

# While loop: Used for repeated execution as long as a condition is True
# Example 1: Basic while loop
print("\nWhile loop examples:")
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment the counter (this prevents an infinite loop)

# Example 2: Using while loop with a break condition
sum_of_numbers = 0
number = 1
while True:  # Infinite loop until break condition
    sum_of_numbers += number
    if sum_of_numbers >= 15:
        break  # Exit the loop once sum is greater than or equal to 15
    number += 1
print(f"The sum of numbers until it exceeds 15 is: {sum_of_numbers}")

# Example 3: Using while loop with continue (to skip current iteration)
print("\nSkipping even numbers:")
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop for even numbers
    print(num)  # Only prints odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

# 3. Combining Control Structures

# Example: Finding the largest number in a list
numbers = [1, 9, 3, 7, 5]
largest = numbers[0]
for number in numbers:
    if number > largest:
        largest = number
print(f"The largest number in the list is: {largest}")
