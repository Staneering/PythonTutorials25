# Python Basics

## 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It’s widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.

### Key Features:
- Simple and easy-to-read syntax.
- Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
- Extensive standard library.
- Cross-platform.

## 2. Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are used to store data. Python has several built-in data types:

### Common Data Types:
- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `10`, `-5`
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-2.71`
- **Strings**: Text enclosed in quotes, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`, `'Python'`
- **Booleans**: Represents `True` or `False`
- **None**: A special type that represents the absence of a value.

### Example:
```python
integer = 10
floating_point = 3.14
string = "Hello, Python!"
boolean = True
```

## 3. Operators

Python has various operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.

### Arithmetic Operators:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `//` (Floor Division)
- `%` (Modulo)
- `**` (Exponentiation)

### Comparison Operators:
- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

### Logical Operators:
- `and` (True if both conditions are true)
- `or` (True if at least one condition is true)
- `not` (Inverts the truth value)

### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 5
sum_result = a + b  # 15
is_equal = a == b  # False
is_greater = a > b  # True
```

---

## 4. Control Structures

Control structures help control the flow of execution in Python.

### Conditional Statements:
Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```

### Loops:
- **`for` loop**: Used for iterating over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc.)
- **`while` loop**: Repeats as long as the condition is `True`.

#### Example:
```python
# For loop example
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4

# While loop example
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## 5. Functions

Functions allow you to group a set of statements to perform a specific task. Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword.

### Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Arguments and Return Values:
- Functions can take arguments and return values.
- You can return multiple values using tuples.

```python
def add_and_multiply(a, b):
    return a + b, a * b

sum_result, product_result = add_and_multiply(3, 4)
```

---

## 6. Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

These are the primary data structures in Python.

### Lists:
- Ordered, mutable collection.
- Can store elements of different data types.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", True]
my_list.append(4)  # Adds an element
```

### Tuples:
- Ordered, immutable collection.
- Often used for fixed data sets.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

### Dictionaries:
- Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- Keys must be unique.

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```

---

## 7. String Manipulation

Python provides a range of methods for working with strings, such as:

- **Concatenation**: Joining two or more strings.
- **Slicing**: Extracting a part of a string.
- **String methods**: `upper()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, `split()`, etc.

### Example:
```python
string = "Python Programming"
print(string[0:6])  # Output: Python
print(string.lower())  # Output: python
```

---

## 8. Exception Handling

Python uses `try`, `except`, and `finally` to handle exceptions (errors during execution).

### Example:
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # Division by zero error
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always run.")
```

## 9. Conclusion

This section covered some of the foundational elements of Python, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and basic data structures. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and readable Python code.
